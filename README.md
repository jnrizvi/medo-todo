# VideoTimer
Markup your video timeline with icons while you record footage to make editing easier later.

## Installation
```
npm install
tsc build
.\website\index.html
```
## Usage
* Open the webpage up on your phone/tablet/touchscreen for silent marking while recording
* Start your video recording and the VideoTimer at the same time
* At the end of each statement, mark it with an icon that represents what happens in the previous time space [eg. ✔ -> "good take", ✂ -> "cut this out"]
* Hit stop on the timer, which should open a new page with all the tags and their timestamps
* Reference time-stamps to split up footage in your video editor of choice at the indicated points in time, removing the takes that didn't work and keeping the ones that did
